## Usability testing
Usability testing consists of watching people try to use a thing (eg. website, application, tool) with the goal of finding ways to make it easier to use. It is a qualitative approach to user experience testing that consists of:

- Creating tasks that a participant will attempt to accomplish during the test. The tasks are written to test specific aspects of the product.
- A facilitator sitting down with a participant and asking that person to try to accomplish the tasks while encouraging them to think out loud.
- Observers gathering in another room to watch the test using screen-sharing software and recorded audio.
- A debrief session after each test to compare notes and identify which problems should be fixed.

## Before the test
- Read this guide and familiarize yourself with the usability testing process. Contact the facilitator with any questions or concerns you have.
- Obtain a copy of the test tasks and the Usability Test Observer Worksheet. The organizer will share these with you.
- Test the remote connection for live screen/audio with the test facilitator.


## During the test

- **Meet** in a room with the other observers to remotely watch the usability test session as a live screen/audio recording.

- **Take notes** about anything interesting you notice

- At the end of the test, **fill out your Usability Test Observer Worksheet** with the three most serious usability problems you observed in the session. Think about what you observed based on the participant’s interactions with the interface.

### Things to watch out for
- Note when the user was confused or couldn’t complete a task
- Where possible, record quotes from users that support your observations
- Avoid inferences or stated user opinions that are not supported by observation
- Remember that we are testing the product and not the participant!

## After the test
- Meet to debrief and share your observations with the team as soon as possible after the test. The test facilitator will lead a discussion in which you will share the three most important problems that you noticed with the group. The goal of the debrief is to identify and prioritize the most serious usability problems to ensure that they are fixed first. There will always be more problems, so we want to focus on the problems that:
  - Prevent users from accomplishing a task or would interfere with the primary functions of the interface.
  - Are experienced by multiple users.

- Hand in your Usability Test Observer Worksheet to the facilitator to help them with writing a report.

## Follow up
After all tests and debriefs in a testing round are complete (usually 3-4 tests), the facilitator will produce a report to communicate our findings with the design and development teams. These teams will work to fix the problems, and further testing will be scheduled as planned/necessary.
