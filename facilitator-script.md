## Before Each Test
- [ ] Give observers the test tasks, Instructions for Observers, and Observer Worksheet
- [ ] Prepare the task text to share with participant
- [ ] Prepare to record task difficulty rating
- [ ] Prepare consent form for non-staff participants
- [ ] Connect test laptop to ethernet/wifi
- [ ] If using Morae for in-person testing: share IP address with remote observers to connect via Morae Observer, open Morae recorded, and test mic
- [ ] If using Zoom for remote testing: test Zoom recording capabilities and ensure local setting allow giving screen control to user
- [ ] Check the setup to be able to incorporate any assistive technology that the user requires
- [ ] Clear browser cache
- [ ] Turn off any browser extensions/addons
- [ ] Set browser to testing target page

## Prologue

Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything.

You have some idea of what we’ll be doing here, but I’m going to go over things briefly to make sure everything makes sense to you. Does that sound good?

We’re asking people to try using [product], so we can see whether it functions as intended. The session should take about [estimated length of test].

The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing this site, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. As you use the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and your impressions and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us.

Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.

### In-person test
You may have noticed the microphone. With your permission, I’m going to record what happens on the screen and our conversation. The recording will only be used to help figure out how to improve the site, and I’ll delete it when I finish reporting our findings, It won’t be seen by anyone except the team working on this project. It definitely helps me refer back to things, so I don’t have to take as many notes. Does that sound ok?

Ok. If you would, I’m going to ask you to sign a simple consent form to record this session.

[Give the person a form and a pen. Start the screen recorder and minimize it as they sign the form.]

### Remote test
We’ll be doing this through Zoom’s screen control feature where I’ll share my screen, and then give you control over it to be able to use the mouse and enter text on the screen as if it were your own. You may experience some slight delay when moving the mouse or entering text due to Zoom technical limitations.

[Test the screen control with the testing participant.]

Ok, so you should have control of the screen. If you click somewhere, can you move the mouse? The only thing we can both see is this browser window. I can’t see your Zoom chat or video windows. You may want to minimize those yourself to be able to see the full website window.

With your permission, I’m going to record what happens on the screen and our conversation. The recording will only be used to help figure out how to improve the site, and I’ll delete it when I finish reporting our findings, It won’t be seen by anyone except the team working on this project. It definitely helps me refer back to things, so I don’t have to take as many notes. Does that sound ok?

Ok. Is it ok if I start the recorder now so I can read consent form and get a verbal agreement from you?

[Start the screen recorder. Read consent form to participant and ask them to state their name and agreement.]

## Testing

Do you have any questions so far?
Great, let’s start looking at things!

Feel free to take control and explore, but for now just stay on this page. Based on what you see here, can you just talk me through what you perceive this site to be for? What would you expect to be able to do here?

[Allow them to talk for a minute.]

Now I’m going to ask you to do some specific exercises. I’m going to read each one out loud and give you the text to read. After you’re done with each one, I’ll ask you to rate how difficult it was. Again, remember that we’re testing the site, and not you. It’s perfectly okay to say if you find an exercise to be difficult!

And remember, as much as possible, it will help us if you can try to think out loud as you go along.

[If other people are observing the session live: check for messages from observers.]

## For Each Exercise

[Hand the user a printout of the task or paste it into the chat. Read it out loud. Allow them to work through the task and talk about what they are doing and thinking.]

[[When the user is done with each task, ask them to rate its difficulty.]

On a scale of one to five, with one being easy and five being difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of this exercise?

[For more information, if necessary]
Can you explain to me what was difficult?

## Wrap up
That’s all the exercises I have!

Do you have any questions for me at this point?

That completes this usability test. Thank you so much for your time! I’ll go ahead and stop the recording and I’d love to hear any feedback you have about this remote testing process.
