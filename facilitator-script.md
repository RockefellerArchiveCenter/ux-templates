## Prologue

Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything.

You have some idea of what we’ll be doing here, but I’m going to go over things briefly to make sure everything makes sense to you. Does that sound good?

We’re asking people to try using [test property], so we can see whether it functions as intended. The session should take about [estimated length of test].

The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing this [site/tool], not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. As you use it, I’m going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and your impressions and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us.

Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to improve the site/tool], so we need to hear your honest reactions. If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help, but if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.

You may have noticed the microphone. With your permission, we’re going to record what happens on the screen and our conversation. The recording will only be used by the people working on this study to help us figure out how to improve things, and we’ll delete it when we finish reporting on our findings.

[If other people are observing the session]:
Also, other folks from my team will be observing this session in another room. They are observing remotely so that they aren’t a distraction to us here, and can help me interpret things to make decisions about how to make improvements based on what we learn here.

If you would, I’m going to ask you to sign a simple permission form. It just says that we have your permission to record this session, and that the recording will only be seen by the people working on the project.

GIVE THE PERSON A FORM AND A PEN. START THE SCREEN RECORDER AS THEY SIGN THE FORM AND MINIMIZE.

##  Testing

Do you have any questions so far?
Ok, before we jump in, I’d like to ask a few questions [Add appropriate warm-up questions]

Great, let’s start looking at things!

OPEN THE BROWSER WINDOW SET TO THE TEST PROPERTY

I am going to ask you to look at this page and tell me what you make of it. What strikes you about it, what can you do here and what’s it for. Just look around and do a little narrative. And for now, just stay on the homepage.

ALLOW THEM TO LOOK AROUND AND TALK FOR A MINUTE

Now I’m going to ask you to do some specific exercises. I’m going to read each one out loud and give you a printed copy. After you’re done with each one, I’ll ask you to rate how difficult it was. Again, remember that we’re testing the site, and not you. It’s perfectly okay to say if you find an exercise to be difficult!

And remember, as much as possible, it will help us if you can try to think out loud as you go along.

[If other people are observing the session]:
CHECK FOR ANY MESSAGES FROM OBSERVERS

## For Each Exercise

HAND USER PRINTOUT OF TASK AND READ IT OUT LOUD. ALLOW THEM TO WORK AND TALK THROUGH THE TASK.

WHEN USER IS DONE WITH EACH TASK, ASK THEM TO RATE ITS DIFFICULTY

On a scale of one to five, with one being easy and five being difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of this exercise?

Can you explain to me what was difficult?

## Wrap up
That’s all the exercises I have!

Do you have any questions for me at this point?

That completes this usability test. Thank you so much for your time!
