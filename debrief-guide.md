title: Guide to Facilitating a Usability Test Debrief Session
---

## Purpose
The purpose of a debrief session is to identify and discuss observed problems that arose during usability testing. A debrief session should be held as soon as possible after each test. The goals of the session are to:
1. Create a list of the most serious usability problems that the participant encountered using the site.
2. Prioritize which problems should be fixed.
3. Determine if certain issues require further testing.

Findings will be summarized in a report prepared by the test facilitator or another designated team member following each round of testing.

## How to run a debrief session
The debrief facilitator asks each member of the team to share with the group the top three most serious problems that they noticed during the test.

The facilitator will write each problem on a whiteboard/flip chart/projected screen. If a problem was observed in previous tests, they will note that. The facilitator will then go through each problem in the list and lead a discussion about which are the most serious.

While some discussion about how to fix a problem may arise, the focus of the debrief is primarily to identify the most serious usability problems that can be prioritized to be fixed rather than specify the implementation of a solution.

## Follow up
The session facilitator will document the issues in an Asana board or as GitHub issues to facilitate report production and communication with developers and other project team members.
