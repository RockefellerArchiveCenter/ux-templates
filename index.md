title: Usability Testing at the Rockefeller Archive Center
---

##Approach and Planning 
One of the Digital Programs Team’s core activities is supporting and advocating for the usability of archival systems and processes at the RAC. Driven by our desire to facilitate broad and equitable access to archival materials, we take a user-centered approach to design and implementation, striving to improve user experience by engaging users throughout all stages of the implementation and systems lifecycle through user research, usability testing, and communication with stakeholders.

This document specifies the roles, process, and associated documentation that make up our approach to usability testing. This strategy is informed by Steve Krug’s book Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems (2010), which emphasizes iterative and incremental tactics with a focus on early and frequent testing.

##Roles
Facilitator, project lead, and reporter may be the same person.

###UX project lead 
Create testing plan, coordinate task creation and revision, recruit participants and observers, schedule tests, manage report production, file participant consent forms. 

###Facilitator
Facilitate usability tests including pilot tests, lead debrief sessions, contribute to report production.

###Reporter
Observe or facilitate tests, participate in debrief session, draft reports for project team.

###Observer/s 
Watch live tests, take notes, identify problems, participate in debrief

###Test participant
Meet with the facilitator and attempt to accomplish the tasks and talk through their experience of using the product.

##Testing Process
The process of conducting usability tests is iterative and incremental: plan, build, test, repeat.
1. In coordination with designers and developers, draft tasks and associated scenarios that target project components and processes that are to be tested.
2. Recruit participants from project user communities.
3. Recruit observers.
4. Conduct a pilot test without recording or observers.
5. Conduct 3-4 usability tests where participants are recorded as they attempt to accomplish the tasks and talk through their experience of using the product.
6. Conduct a debrief after each test with observers to identify the most serious problems.
7. Prepare a short report for the project design and development teams and coordinate with those teams to fix the problems.
8.Repeat.
9. Conduct shorter, more informal tests as needed.

##Documentation and deliverables
Formal facilitator script
This can be adapted to for informal A/B or low fidelity prototype testing with or without observers.
Recording consent form
Signature needed prior to test for non-RAC staff participants.
Tasks
For the facilitator and observers.
Tasks and difficulty ratings
A handout for participants with each task on its own page to reference during test and to indicate task difficulty rating.
Instructions for observers
Observer worksheet
A handout to record the three most serious problems and any associated participant quotes. Completed worksheets are given to the facilitator after the debrief to help with reporting.
Guide to running a usability test debrief session
A guide for the facilitator.
Report
An actionable summary of testing results for the project team/s.

Accessible User Experience QA
Recommendations for incorporating accessibility considerations into project management, design, development, UX testing, and as part of community participation and leadership
Accessibility Conformance Report using the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) 
Completed as necessary to facilitate accessibility auditing and communication to external users and stakeholders. This is prepared at a late stage to correspond with project release. 
External project report
Completed as necessary to communicate to project stakeholders.
