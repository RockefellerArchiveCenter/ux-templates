title: Usability Testing at the Rockefeller Archive Center
---

## Approach and Planning
One of the Digital Programs Teamâ€™s core activities is supporting and advocating for the usability of archival systems and processes at the RAC. Driven by our desire to facilitate broad and equitable access to archival materials, we take a user-centered approach to design and implementation, striving to improve user experience by engaging users throughout all stages of the implementation and systems lifecycle through user research, usability testing, and communication with stakeholders.

Our templates and guides facilitate testing with users in order to improve the user experience of our systems.
