title: Usability Testing at the Rockefeller Archive Center
---

## Introduction
These templates and guides are intended for Rockefeller Archive Center staff to use for rapid, iterative, and scalable usability testing to center user perspectives and continually improve the usability and accessibility of our systems and collections.

The templates are not prescriptive, but are designed to be adapted for various team sizes, experience, goals, and types of user interfaces. The testing approach is informed by Steve Krugâ€™s book _Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems (2010)_, which emphasizes iterative and incremental tactics with a focus on early and frequent testing.

## Roles
The recommended roles and associated activities to plan, conduct, and evaluate usability tests. Multiple roles can be filled by the same person.

- **UX project lead**: Create testing plan, coordinate task creation and revision, recruit participants and observers, schedule tests, manage report production, file participant consent forms.
- **Facilitator**: Facilitate usability tests including pilot tests, lead debrief sessions, contribute to report production.
- **Reporter**: Observe or facilitate tests, participate in debrief session, draft reports for project team.
- **Observer/s**: Watch tests, take notes, identify problems, participate in debrief.
- **Test participant**: Meet with the facilitator and attempt to accomplish the tasks and talk through their experience of using the product.

## Usability Testing Process
The usability testing process is iterative and incremental:
1. Plan
2. Test
3. Evaluate
4. Implement

Repeat as necessary.
### Plan
1. In coordination with designers, developers, and other project stakeholders, identify features and processes that necessitate testing with users. Draft tasks and a testing script to target these features.
2. Recruit participants from project user communities.
3. Recruit observers who represent stakeholders.
4. Conduct a pilot study to test the test and make any necessary adjustments to the tasks and script.

Documents/deliverables:

- **[Facilitator script](/facilitator-script)**: The script keeps tests consistent and helps the facilitator to stay organized. The script can also be adapted for informal A/B or low fidelity prototype testing with or without observers.
- **[Tasks](/tasks-template)**: Concise scenarios and tasks designed to target specific questions about the usability of the product. The task text will be read aloud and shared directly with participants during the test.

### Test

Conduct 3-4 usability tests. With permission from participants, record the screen and audio as the user attempts to accomplish the tasks and talks through their experience of using the product.

Documents/deliverables:
- **[Recording consent form](/consent)**: Informed consent should be obtained prior to recording participants. Obtain the participant's signature for in-person testing, or obtain a recorded verbal consent for remote testing.

- **Tasks and difficulty ratings**: A handout for participants with the text of each task on its own page to reference during test and to indicate task difficulty rating. For remote tests, the facilitator can share the tasks in chat and record the difficulty rating separately.

### Evaluate

1. Conduct a debrief with observers to identify the most serious usability problems. Debrief sessions can be held after each test, or after a set of tests.

Documents/deliverables:
- **[Instructions for observers](/observer-directions)**: A handout to orient new observers to the usability testing process and their role.
- **[Observer worksheet](/observer-worksheet)**: A handout that can be used to help structure the observers' notes to facilitate the debrief session and share with the reporter.
- **[Guide to running a usability test debrief session](/debrief-guide)**: A guide for the debrief session facilitator.

### Implement
Prepare a short report for the project team identifying usability problems, how serious they are, and possible solutions. Coordinate with the project team to implement solutions.

Documents/deliverables:
- **[Report](/report)**: An actionable summary of testing results for the project team/s. The report format can be adjusted according to the needs of the team.
- **External project report**: An optional report to communicate observations and resulting actions to project stakeholders outside of the project team.
